    "Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a test that high schoolers take in the US before applying to college. Colleges take the test scores into account when making admissions decisions, so it's fairly important to do well on. The test is divided into 3 sections, each of which is scored out of 800 points. The total score is out of 2400 (although this has changed back and forth a few times, the scores in this dataset are out of 2400). High schools are often ranked by their average SAT scores, and high SAT scores are considered a sign of how good a school district is.\n",

    "* NY city has 5 districts \n",
    "* NY has several school districts and each of which can contains dozens of schools \n",
    "* Not all the schools in all of the datasets are high schools, so I need to do some data cleaning. \n",
    "* Each school in NY has a unique code it's `DBN` or District Borough Number\n",
    "* By aggregating data by district, I can use the district mapping data to plot district-by-district differences.\n",
