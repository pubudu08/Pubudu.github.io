This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. A separate category is for separate projects.

## Stand-alone projects.

### FraudStudy: A Hybrid Deep-learning model to detect fraudulent customers

[Github](https://github.com/pubudu08/pubudu08.github.io/blob/master/Noteboooks/FraudStudy.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pubudu08/pubudu08.github.io/blob/master/Noteboooks/FraudStudy.ipynb)

This is a hybrid engine combining two deep learning models; ANN and SOM (Self-Organizing Map) to detect fraud. Used SOM to locate the fraudulent customers and feed it in to ANN to identify the predicted probability ranking of fraud customers. My goal was to determine the highest predicted probability of fraud. Dataset: Statlog(Aus. credit approval)

Motivation: To build an engine composed with supervised and unsupervised deep-learning models 

## Classification problems.

### Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

[Github](https://github.com/pubudu08/pubudu08.github.io/blob/master/Noteboooks/FraudStudy.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pubudu08/pubudu08.github.io/blob/master/Noteboooks/FraudStudy.ipynb)

Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. Many people started practicing in machine learning with this competition, so did I. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
Titanic dataset provides interesting opportunities for feature engineering.


## Natural language processing.

### Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn

[Github](https://github.com/pubudu08/pubudu08.github.io/blob/master/Noteboooks/Word2Vec.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pubudu08/pubudu08.github.io/blob/master/Noteboooks/Word2Vec.ipynb)

Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn is a sentimental analysis problem. Based on texts of reviews we predict whether they are positive or negative. General description and data are available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial).
The data provided consists of raw reviews and class (1 or 2), so the main part is cleaning the texts.


## Clustering

### Clustering with KMeans

[Github](https://github.com/pubudu08/pubudu08.github.io/blob/master/Noteboooks/K-Means.ipynb) [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pubudu08/pubudu08.github.io/blob/master/Noteboooks/K-Means.ipynb)

Clustering is an approach to unsupervised machine learning. Clustering with KMeans is one of algorithms of clustering. in this notebook I'll demonstrate how it works.
